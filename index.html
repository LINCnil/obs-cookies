        </div>
        <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">
            To display a web page, a browser communicates with the remote server corresponding to the domain name
            indicated in the address bar. This address corresponds to the main domain, which
            the user wishes to view the content from. For example, cnil.fr corresponds to the main domain of the <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/home">CNIL website</a>.
            However, most of the data exchanges carried out by the browser when loading a page are made with
            other actors, third parties, in order to provide functionality to users or to collect their personal data (e.g. statistics, browsing data,
            instant messaging, etc.).

        </div>
        <div class="bloc B3 M3 S9">
            Cookies are pieces of information stored in the browser and transmitted with each communication with the
            specific domain by which they have been dropped.
            This information can be used to uniquely identify web users when they browse the Web.
            When a communication is associated with one or more cookie(s), it is therefore possible to identify the
            terminal of an individual
            and to link together the different webpages accessed by this user from its terminal.
            Some techniques also allow to link together the different terminals (computer, tablet, smartphone) or
            browsers of the same web user to reconstitute a global history of his navigation.
            <br><br>
            These tracking mechanisms allow advertisers to collect navigation data from web
            users in order to build advertising profiles.
            For example, the keywords searched for by web users can allow a better understanding of their center of
            interest, and by extension
            infer the product they are more likely to purchase. They are then retained by these players to improve their targeted
            advertising algorithm.

            The CNIL has repealed in 2019 its
            recommendation "relating to cookies and other tracking devices" and has published new guidelines to explain
            the applicable legal framework and how consent should be collected, when necessary.

            Following consultation with members of the digital advertising ecosystem and the civil society, on the one hand, and after a public consultation, on the other hand, the CNIL published on October 1, 2020, the result of its work on "cookies and other tracking devices".

            These guidelines and recommendations aim to support professionals in bringing the cookies (or similar technologies) they use on their sites or mobile applications into compliance with the applicable legal framework.
